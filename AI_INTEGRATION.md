  Step 8: Recommendation Algorithm

  Content-Based Recommendations:
  - Find books similar to user's reading history
  - Exclude already purchased books
  - Diversify recommendations (avoid too similar books)
  - Boost popular books slightly

  Recommendation Types:
  - "More like books you've read" (content similarity)
  - "Popular in your interests" (trending + similar)
  - "You might also like" (for individual book pages)
  - "New arrivals for you" (recent books + user preferences)

  Step 9: Recommendation UI Components

  New Components:
  - Recommendation cards with explanations
  - "Similar Books" widget on book detail pages
  - Personalized homepage sections
  - "Why recommended?" tooltips

  Display Features:

  - Search by mood or theme
  - "Find similar books" from any book page

  Search Improvements:
  - Search result explanations ("Found because of: author similarity")
  - Search suggestions as user types
  - Recent searches history
  - Popular search terms

  Step 11: Content Analysis

  Automatic Classification:
  - Genre detection from book descriptions
  - Topic extraction (main themes)
  - Reading difficulty estimation
  - Content mood analysis (happy, sad, exciting)

  Implementation:
  - Use zero-shot classification for genres
  - Extract keywords using TF-IDF
  - Analyze sentence complexity for difficulty
  - Implement simple sentiment analysis

  Step 12: Performance Optimization

  Caching Strategy:
  - Cache embeddings in browser LocalStorage
  - Redis caching for search results
  - CDN caching for popular queries
  - Precompute recommendations for active users

  Speed Optimizations:
  - Lazy load recommendation models
  - Use quantized models for browser
  - Implement progressive search (show results as they arrive)
  - Optimize database queries with proper indexes

  Phase 5: Testing & Integration (Week 5)

  Step 13: Quality Assurance

  Testing Scenarios:
  - Test semantic search with various Burmese queries
  - Verify recommendation relevance with test users
  - Check system performance with concurrent users

  - New user ‚Üí should get popular books

  Step 14: User Experience Testing

```

#### **Part 5: Analytics & Business Impact (1 minute)**
```markdown
"The system tracks everything:"

*Show analytics dashboard*

"- Workflow success rates
- Social media engagement
- Time savings (2-3 hours ‚Üí 2 minutes)
- Scalability (1 book ‚Üí 100 books same effort)"
```

### **Technical Deep Dive (5 minutes)**
```markdown
"Let me show you the technical innovation:

1. **Workflow Orchestration**: Enterprise-grade n8n automation
2. **AI Integration**: Custom Myanmar language processing

Social Media Bridging
Payment System
Progressive Web App (Responsiveness Design)
n8n Social media promoting tools
Dashboard
AWS S3 for Storage or AWS Lambda Functions
 
R1chart — 23/07/2025, 09:48
No-Code/Low-Code Automation Integration
A. n8n or Zapier Integration

Set up n8n or Zapier automation for your publishing workflow (e.g., “When manuscript is approved, send automatic email to author, or post update in Slack/Discord/Telegram”).

Show a live n8n workflow as a visual! Professors love seeing automation.

-
- 
Cloud/Serverless or Modern DevOps
A. AWS S3 for Storage or AWS Lambda Functions

Move file storage from Supabase to AWS S3, or add Lambda function for custom processing (e.g., automatic PDF to EPUB conversion).

Could even do: Generate a book cover thumbnail using AWS Rekognition or Lambda.
-
- 
Analytics/Dashboard
A. Real-Time Analytics

Add a dashboard for publishers: track views, downloads, reading time, popular books—use Supabase Realtime or integrate Google Analytics/Firebase/Amplitude.

Make your dashboard look professional with charts (Recharts, Chart.js, etc).
-
-
Progressive Web App (PWA) / Offline-first
Make the app installable as a PWA with offline reading (using service workers + your hybrid storage).

Professors love when you demo “turn off wifi and it still works!”

R1chart — 23/07/2025, 10:25
⏺ Yes, all of these are definitely possible to add to your Myanmar publishing platform! Here's the feasibility breakdown:

  ✅ Highly Feasible & Impressive

  Social Chat Bridging (Telegram Integration)
  
Use Telegram Bot API to embed chat interface
Real-time sync with your existing Supabase chat system
Very impressive for professors

  Progressive Web App (PWA)
  
Next.js has built-in PWA support
Add manifest.json + service worker
Offline reading capability would be amazing

  Dashboard
  
Perfect fit with your existing admin/publisher roles
Analytics, sales metrics, user engagement
Can leverage your Supabase data

  ✅ Moderate Effort, High Impact

  Payment System
  
Integrate Stripe/PayPal (replace fake payment)
Myanmar payment gateways (KBZPay, WavePay)
Essential upgrade from current fake system

  AWS S3 Storage
  
Replace Supabase storage for book files
Better for large PDF/EPUB files
Cost-effective scaling

  ⚠️ More Complex but Doable

  n8n Social Media Promotion
  
Automate posts when books are published
Facebook/Instagram API integration
Requires n8n server setup

  AWS Lambda Functions
  
Serverless book processing
PDF thumbnail generation
Text extraction for search

  🚀 My Recommendation Priority

  
PWA + Responsive Design (quick wins)
Telegram Chat Integration (very impressive)
Real Payment System (essential)
Dashboard with Analytics (professional touch)
AWS S3 Storage (scalability)
n8n Automation (if time permits)

  Want me to help implement any of these? I'd suggest starting with PWA since it's quick but very impressive to professors!

I want

Yh . Just these two. Start make implementation plan. For embedding model , just use intfloat/multilingual-e5-base. Ultrathink
R1chart — Yesterday at 17:58
looking at it, i want to change or remind you or some stuff. 

First, the metadata of the book that you will get is id, name, author, description, category, tags, price, image, (Check supabase for that).

Also OpenAI is not free. Maybe use Gemini which is also kinda free and support Myanmar

Next i think the social media posting can be anytime. I guess during day is better so just check if it is during day then it's okay 

Next i don't know what's Slack Notification but the publisher and author uses app like telegram and messenger. mostly ofc. Maybe Slack is a notification sender idk.

make the book showcase same for editors

. The fact that they have to scroll a lot

R1chart — Yesterday at 19:14
I want to add the status tab like Author too but i think this is better. Go to each status book when clicked this And i don't know what's the difference between pending review and under review. Put only one there and also add rejected review.
You know what? Add Pending Review again. Might have to make changes on Supabase Database idk . go check there. Also add ALL tab too. On books that are in Pending Review, there should be button to tick to Under Review and it moves to Under review
R1chart — Yesterday at 20:03
Next fix, When Editor Reject a submitted book with a comment, Author may fix the book. And on the same data , re-submit again. 
Then Editor will see the Pending Review, (should somehow think of putting a UI in a way that this is the second submission, might also need to do some modification in database). And Editor should still see the previous comment feedback that he give to this book so that he can check if the fix aligns with the comment.
R1chart — Yesterday at 22:07
not bad but First of 
the feedback messages display are bad. You need to brainstorm a better way. Also display for author too
the bookcard are small.  Make it bigger. For both author and editor.
R1chart — 09:53
I am thinking of adding a big feature. So listen carefully

I want to make or add a manuscript editor onto here so Author and Editor can check the manuscript and do their work. What do you think ? I want it like Microsoft word document but inside my web. 

Is it possible ? What's the "best" way to do it ?
I want to build Manuscript Editor for Author and Editor

has all the editing tools feature.(most important, must be legit)
Can't use paid feature, must be free. i am student.
has myanmar font support
Support Docx Import
Collaborative Feature between Author and Editor
Comment Feature
Version History
Track Changes

This is for the publishing house's editor to check author's manuscript quality check such as:
spelling
placement /alignment
page number
content titles
suitable colors (optional)
font types


What do you think is the best way to build it ? Ultrathink 
R1chart — 10:09
You’re super close! A few important corrections and tweaks will make this plan solid and truly free.

# Quick fixes to your spec

* **Yjs ≠ OT.** Yjs is a **CRDT** system (conflict-free replicated data type), not Operational Transforms. It gives you built-in conflict resolution and pairs perfectly with ProseMirror via **y-prosemirror** and an awareness API for live cursors. Don’t mix **prosemirror-collab** (the OT-style demo) with Yjs—pick one; for you, **use Yjs only**. ([npm][1], [docs.yjs.dev][2], [ProseMirror][3])
* **“Live cursors out of the box”**: Yjs provides **Awareness**; you still render cursors in PM (a tiny plugin/decoration). Examples in y-prosemirror docs. ([GitHub][4])

This usecase is for when author submit a manuscript and editor want to check the manuscript sent a feedback back. then author make changes on manuscript using the text editor and editor may also use it to make changes.
Short answer: yes—this is a solid, “legit” plan to embed a **free** Word-compatible editor. With a few tweaks you’ll be production-ready.

# What’s great (keep)

* Self-hosted **ONLYOFFICE Document Server (Community)** fits your “free” requirement, supports real-time co-editing, comments, and **Track Changes**. ([GitHub][1])
* Clear separation of concerns (Supabase for auth/storage, Next.js API routes for config/callback, DS for editing).

alright implement according to the plan. if you need access to database you , have supabase MCP. if you want me to 
  add like credentials key or something that you can't access, tell me at the end. Now start the implementation. 
  Ultrathink. Note that the text editor should be access by clicking an edit button next to the thebook card in the 
  author and editor dashboard. Now start.

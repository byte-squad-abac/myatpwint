# Implementation Plan: OnlyOffice Book Reader

## Phase 1: Analysis & Architecture ✅

### 1. ✅ Analyze Current OnlyOffice Implementation

- ✅ Review existing ManuscriptEditor component structure
- ✅ Examine OnlyOffice JWT configuration in /api/onlyoffice/config
- ✅ Identify reusable parts vs. what needs modification
- ✅ Check file access patterns from Supabase storage

### 2. ✅ Design BookReader Component Architecture

- ✅ Create separate BookReader component (similar to ManuscriptEditor)
- ✅ Design viewer-specific configuration
- ✅ Plan file access workflow: Book ID → Purchase verification → File access
- ✅ Design reading UI (fullscreen, navigation, controls)

## Phase 2: Backend Implementation ✅

### 3. ✅ Create API Endpoint for Book Reading

**File**: `/src/app/api/onlyoffice/book-config/route.ts`
- ✅ Verify user owns the book (check purchases table)
- ✅ Generate signed URL for book file from storage
- ✅ Configure OnlyOffice in viewer mode
- ✅ Return JWT-secured configuration

### 4. ✅ File Storage Preparation

- ✅ Ensure books have DOCX files in Supabase storage
- ✅ Create file naming convention: book-{bookId}.docx
- ✅ Implement file migration if needed (from manuscript files)

## Phase 3: Frontend Implementation ✅

### 5. ✅ Implement BookReader Component

**File**: `/src/components/BookReader/BookReader.tsx`
- ✅ Reuse ManuscriptEditor structure but for viewing
- ✅ Configure OnlyOffice with viewer mode settings
- ✅ Add reader-specific controls (zoom, navigation)
- ✅ Handle loading and error states

### 6. ✅ Create Book Reading Page

**File**: `/src/app/read/[bookId]/page.tsx`
- ✅ New route for book reading
- ✅ Load BookReader component
- ✅ Handle authentication and ownership verification
- ✅ Full-screen reading experience

## Phase 4: Integration ✅

### 7. ✅ Update Library Page **COMPLETED**

**File**: `/src/app/(dashboards)/library/page.tsx:186-188`
- ✅ Replace "Reading Feature Coming Soon" with functional "Read Now" button
- ✅ Link to `/read/[bookId]` route
- ✅ Only show for digital books that user owns
- ✅ Add loading states for book access

### 8. ✅ Add Security & Access Control

- ✅ Verify book ownership before allowing access
- ✅ Implement session management for reading
- ✅ Add middleware protection for reading routes
- ⏳ Log reading activity (optional)

## Phase 5: Enhancement & Polish ⏳

### 9. ✅ Reading Progress Tracking

- ✅ Track reading session start/end times
- ✅ Store last read position  
- ✅ Add "Continue Reading" functionality in library
- ✅ Database migration applied with reading_progress table
- ✅ Progress display with reading time and completion percentage
- ✅ Smart button text: "Start Reading" vs "Continue Reading"

### 10. ⏳ Test & Polish

- ⏳ Test with various DOCX formats
- ⏳ Ensure mobile responsiveness
- ⏳ Performance optimization
- ⏳ User experience improvements

## Key Technical Decisions

### OnlyOffice Viewer Configuration
```typescript
editorConfig: {
  mode: 'view',           // Read-only
  customization: {
    about: false,
    feedback: false,
    toolbar: true,        // Keep minimal navigation
    header: false,        // Clean reading experience
    goback: {
      url: '/library',
      text: 'Back to Library'
    }
  }
}
```

### File Access Workflow
1. User clicks "Read Now" in library
2. Route to `/read/[bookId]`
3. API verifies purchase ownership
4. Generate signed URL for book file
5. Configure OnlyOffice viewer
6. Render BookReader component

### Security Considerations
- JWT tokens for OnlyOffice access
- Purchase verification before file access
- Signed URLs with expiration
- Download/print permissions for digital books

## Implementation Priority
**Essential**: Steps 1-7 (Core reading functionality) ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Nice-to-have**: Steps 8-10 (Progress tracking, polish) ⏳

## Current Status: 
- **Phases 1-4**: ✅ **COMPLETED** 
- **Phase 5**: 
  - **Step 9**: ✅ **COMPLETED** (Reading progress tracking)
  - **Step 10**: ⏳ **PENDING** (Testing and polish)
